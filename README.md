# PracticeSite
Some code from me learning and practicing website development with html and css.

I want to learn how to do web development with HTML and CSS for fun and to possibly make a website for my girlfriend. She is currently in beauty school and I'd like to make her a website for her that will allow her to post photos, updates and other such things. The website would also allow people to find her rates and request/sign up for an appointment with her.
